Controls: arrow keys

WARNING!
This is just a script demo that is NOT mobile friendly! 
This is just to demonstrate a memory saving script I have been working on 
that infinite generates vertical procedural stages for our grappling hook game.
If you move up, there will be infinite green, but as soon as you move down there will be a missing stage
This is intentional, our character in the final game will never move down.
